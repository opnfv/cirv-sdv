# devices) and Networks (i.e. layer 3 configurations). The following is standard
# for the logical networks in Airship:

# For standard Airship deployments, you should not need to modify the number of
# NetworkLinks and Networks in this file. Only the IP addresses and CIDRs should
# need editing.
#
# TODO: Given that we expect all network broadcast domains to span all racks in
# Airship, we should choose network names that do not include the rack number.
